Documentation for the SoNNia package
====================================

SoNNia is a python 3 software which extends the functionality of the [SONIA](https://github.com/statbiophys/SONIA) package and is used to infer selection pressures on features of amino acid CDR3 sequences. 
The inference is based on maximizing the likelihood of observing a selected data sample given a representative pre-selected sample. 
This method was first used in Elhanati et al (2014) to study thymic selection. 
Generally, the pre-selected sample can be generated internally using the OLGA software, 
but SONIA allows it also to be supplied externally, in the same way the data sample is provided.

SoNNia  expands  the  choice  of selection  models that can be inferred with respect to SONIA. 
Non linear single-chain models and (non-)linear paired-chain models are included, as well as a class to compare datasets using the model and
the pre-processing pipeline implemented in the corresponding paper.

SoNNia takes as input CDR3 amino acid sequences, with (or without) V and J genes assignemnt. 
Its output is selection factors that can could be used to calculate the probability
to observe any sequence after selection. 

Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^
SoNNia is a python 3 software. It is available on PyPI and can be downloaded and installed through pip:

    pip install sonnia

SoNNia is also available on [GitHub](https://github.com/statbiophys/sonnia). The command line entry points can be installed by using the setup.py script:

    pip install .
 
Sometimes pip fails to install the dependencies correctly. Thus, if you get any error try first to install the dependencies separately:

    pip install tensorflow matplotlib olga

For mac user on new metal devices, make sure to install additional dependencies to make tensorflow work.

.. note:: **Note about training data preparation**

   SoNNia shines when trained on top of independent rearrangement events, thus
   you should throw away the read count information.
   If you have a sample from an individual, you should keep the unique
   nucleotide rearrangements. This means that in principle there could be few aminoacid
   CDR3,V,J combination that are not unique after the mapping from nucleotide to aminoacid, but that's fine.
   Moreover if you pool data from multiple people you can still keep rearrangements that are found
   in multiple individuals because you are sure that they correspond to independent recombination events.

.. note:: **Note about CDR3 sequence definition**

   This code is quite flexible, however it does demand a very consistent definition of CDR3 sequences.

   **CHECK THE DEFINITION OF THE CDR3 REGION OF THE SEQUENCES YOU INPUT.** This will likely be the most often problem that occurs.
   The default models/genomic data are set up to define the CDR3 region from
   the conserved cysteine C (INCLUSIVE) in the V region to the conserved F or W (INCLUSIVE)
   in the J. This corresponds to definition of a junction in AIRR-C format.
